# Rock-Paper-Scissors-TOP
Rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project
This project works by running a script that first calls for a random number that is used to set the computer choice in a game of rock paper scissors.
This computer choice is then compared to a player choice which is gathered from a prompt that the player must type their choice into.
The game function then compares the computer choice and player choice and determines a winner of the round for a total of 5 rounds. Game winner is determined on a best of 5 rounds.

Currently there is no control on the player typing something random into the choice prompt, this will be handled in the future with a user GUI.
